## Usage

The deployed web application can be accessed at [Photo-Hut](https://ucf-photo-hut.herokuapp.com/).

 Photo Hut allows professional photographers to connect and collaborate in a space devoted to their art, apart from existing social networking applications which focus on promotion of the individual over the content itself. Users create an account that allows them to create a profile to disply their work. Future development plans will allow users to provide links to their other social media accounts such as LinkedIn. Users currently can upload their photos with captions, but the ability to pin their favorite at the top and reorder the photos according to their own design is also in development. Using the Search function, users can browse other profiles, commenting and upvoting. This collaboration allows photographers to follow trends in their community by popularity and gather tips and tricks from others.
